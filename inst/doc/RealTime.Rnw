\begin{abstract}
While many trading systems in production make use of
different languages for different tasks, the ideal
environment from a user standpoint involves a single
language that can handle incoming data, make
trade decisions, and execute all from one environment.
This paper explores the issues relating to managing
this entire process in the {\tt R} programming langauge.

\section{Introduction to Real Time Processing in {\tt R}}
{\tt R} is a statistical programming language based on the
{\tt S} dialect created by Chambers et al at Bell Laboratories.

As a scripting language with a
well-developed interpreter it 
is ideally suited for data exploration as well as rapid
programming. More information as to the merits
of R for modeling and development can be found in
countless papers and books.  It is assumed that the reader
has already been exposed to the virtues of R, and this
paper will focus on extending the prototypical use
to managing real-time processing.

While the R language has traditionally been used for
data analysis and exploration, as well as pre-trade and post-trade
modeling, it can also be used successfully as a
platform to manage the entire trade process. This
paper will explore the rationale, design, implementation,
and limitations
of using R for managing algorithmic trading with R.  It will
conclude with an overview of the open source IBrokers
package that interfaces the Interactive Brokers brokerage
platform from R.

\subsection{Socket Connections in {\tt R}}
R provides a small collection of tools to manage socket
based connections from within the interactive environment.  While
most cases involve the opening of a connection, some read or write
operation, and a subsequent close, it is necessary to extend this
logic to persistent connections to accommodate market data and
asynchonous incoming and outgoing messages.

\subsubsection{Overview}
The basic tools in R to manage socket-based connections
involve five primary functions, with a susbset of interest
including three functions.  These are {\tt socketConnection},
{\tt writeBin}, and {\tt readBin}.

The establish a connection the socketConnection function
is called, and it returns a connection object.  This
connection can be specified to be 

\subsubsection{Usage}
Cover connecting with socketConnection, the read/write semantics,
as well as cross-platform differences.  Provide general insight into
the process as well as practical consideration with respect to
incoming message construction/headers.

\subsection{Technical Challenges in {\tt R}}
While the idea of using R to process incoming data,
apply trade logic, and place orders makes inuitive sense,
it is not without technical challenges. These range from
the single-threaded nature of R, to the fact that R is
interpreted and thus relatively slower than a compiled
solution.  These challenges will be discussed in the following
sections. 

\subsubsection{Asynchronous Requests}
As R is currently single-threaded, and for the foreseable future
will remain so, this becomes a major hurdle to implementing
an algorithmic solution within R.

The conventional wisdom is that managing asynchronous events
within a single thread is difficult at best, or impossible at worst.
As with most things, the true answer lies somewhere in the middle.

Most trade decisions are single-threaded by design: e.g. a price target
is met and an order is placed.  Even trade logic that is not so
simple can usually be factored out to something that fits within
this action|reaction paradigm.

The key challenge in managing this process within a single
process is to be able to manage incoming data external to the
trade decision, and have ready access to it when needed.

The limitation of a single-threaded model is that all
incoming messages must be able to be handled within
the processing constraints of a single R thread.  The
primary constraint in this process is the need
to loop through each distinct message, as each message involves
a seperate call or calls to the underlying {\tt readBin}.

The structure of the incoming message feed, as well as the
computational requirements to parse the feed are integral to
the upper limit that this solution can provide.

\subsubsection{Socket Connection Limits}
As alluded to above, the primary limitation of managing
an event stream in R is that without threads to absord
additional messages, all incoming data must be manageable
within one process and one main event loop.

This limitation is most severe with high frequency data,
specifically streaming market data or limit-order book data.
Depending on the structure of the incoming data, each
distinct message must be dealt with during one pass through
the event loop described below.  If messages are grouped
into aggregate structures containing many distinct messages internally
only one call to {\tt readBin} will be required, and throughput can
be improved dramatically.  This is dependent on the incoming feed, either
from the provider, or an intermediary process.

\subsubsection{Event Loops}
The typical way to manage real-time event streams in
any language would be to take each message as a distinct
unit, process any header information that is contained, and
read the remaining data into memory.  From this point the
individual logic would be application dependent.

Event streams in R follow this same format, where an
infinite loop is constructed using a {\tt while} loop, and at
each iteration a new message is read from the connection.  This
message is then passed to a processing function that branches
based on the message type.  Further handling is application
specific.

\subsubsection{Data Persistence and Sharing}
The final piece to the puzzle for managing live data in R
is the ability to maintain state information.  Within the constraints
of a single R process and event loop it is imperative to maintain
a list of data representing current and possibly recently historical
market prices and sizes, as well as a position type information.

One relatively elegant solution in R is to use environments and
closures to be able to manage arbitrary data structures from
any part of a process. Data managed in this way is accessible
quickly and efficiently from within event handlers.

\section{IBrokers: Using the Interactive Brokers API}
To illustrate the process of using R as an algorithmic
trading environment we will examine how the {\tt IBrokers}
package manages the process.

\subsection{Package Overview}
Interactive Brokers is an electronic
brokerage platform that is popular among active
and algorithmic traders.  They provide a platform
for individual and institutional clients, as well as
a full API to execute orders from a variety of
platforms.

The API is of particular interest for algorithmic
trading.  A supported client toolkit to access this
API is provided in Java, C++, and Excel, using sockets and
Microsoft DDE infrastructure.  Numerous additional interfaces
have been built by the community for programming languages ranging
from Python and Perl, to Matlab and C.  A previously unsupported
platform had been R.  The IBrokers package by this author
is available for no charge from CRAN.  This package provides
a direct interface to the API via socket connections implemented entirely
in R.

In this section we will explore the design objectives of the IBrokers package.
We will also
examine the API implementation details within the context
of using R for managing real-time data.

\subsection{Design Criteria}
The primary design requirement of IBrokers was to
allow for rapid prototyping of trading ideas from within R,
as well as implementation of R-based trade logic, using
Interactive Brokers as both a data feed and execution platform.
This has subsequently evolved to include the possibility of
incorporating a separate data feed external to Interactive Brokers
for the purposes of flexibility and robustness.

\subsection{Message Structure}
The basic structure of the formal API allows for
asynchronous outgoing and incoming messages. The internal
design of incoming messages from the
TraderWorkstation (TWS) is nul terminated byte (char) arrays.
These are easily managed natively in R by
{\tt readBin} using arguments {\tt what=character()}
or {\tt what=raw()} to handle the incoming data types.
The IBrokers implementation makes use
of processing events as 8-bit char arrays as handled
by {\tt what=character()}, which automatically reads
to the first nul-byte and assigns to a character vector.

Each incoming message consists of a single two or three byte char array
as a header, representing a numeric value in the range of
1 to 50, followed by an ASCII nul-byte  The remainder of the message
is comprised of a variable number of nul-terminated messages, with
the length dependent on the incoming message type.  
The full set of incoming message types can
be seen in the internal IBrokers variable {\tt .twsIncomingMSG}.  

Outgoing messages follow the same general logic, with
a header code, followed by the required fields of the request.
These codes can be seen in the internal variable {\tt .twsOutgoingMSG}.

\subsection{Implementation}
The basic logic of the {\tt IBrokers} implementation is
comprised of four main components: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item a request message or messages [e.g. embedded in {\tt reqMktData}]
\item a primary callback function [{\tt twsCALLBACK}]
\item a message/event loop within the callback [{\tt processMsg}]
\item a data/method closure [{\tt eWrapper}] 
to process individual messages and
facilitate trade logic.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Requests}
The basic TWS request is for a single return reply or, as is the case for data
requests, a subscription that will remain active until an appropriate
cancel request is made.  Using IBrokers built-in requests,
most all subscription requests will
be automatically cancelled upon function error or exit.  User generated
requests that utilize the raw API (bypassing IBrokers wrapper functions)
will need to request cancels where appropriate.

The basic request as outlined above consists of a headed code sent as
a character array (a length one character vector in R).  The precise
structure of the message is defined by the API and any deviation will result
in an error at some point in the subsequent process.

For example, to request the current time from the TWS, one needs to send
the code for "Current Time" (.twsOutgoingMSG\$REQ\_CURRENT\_TIME): "49"
and the current version number of the specific request.  In the case of
current time, the version is simply the character "1".
